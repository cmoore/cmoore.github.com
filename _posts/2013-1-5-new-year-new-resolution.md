I'm resolving to do all personal development for one year in Common Lisp.

![](/images/tongue-stuck.jpg "You might think it's a bad idea, but I'm rather looking forward to it.")

In addition, I'm going to actually blog as much as I can about these projects.  I figure with as little current info about Common Lisp development as there is around, I might as well contribute even if I'm only at an intermediate level with the language.
