p(meta). FreeBSD on the desktop

I've always loved FreeBSD and NetBSD for their simplicity and organization.  Plus, the ports trees really make things nice.

After my last game-fest with <a href="http://twitter.com/apnelson">@apnelson</a> I decided to start using it full time and the results are great.  I haven't found anything that I'd like to do that I can't.  Now, sure, the setup and configuration isn't as fire-and-forget as Ubuntu, but I swear it's an order of magnitude faster.

Also, everyone seems to be convinced that I have adult ADD, most notably my wife.  So I went and saw a doctor yesterday and he seems just as if not more convinced.  Now I just have to wait 6 MONTHS to see them again.  If you are a psychiatrist, apparently there's an incredible demand for your services in the Seattle area.

Also, I have to plan my 5th wedding anniversary today so I'm absolutely stressed to the max to get that right.  Yay.
