My professional life apparently begins at 39.

# Abstract (a professional way to say tl;dr)

This is a post about my experience first denying that I had a problem with, and, much later, getting help with Adult ADHD.

# Let's play pretend!

Imagine for a moment that from the time you woke up every morning to the time you went to bed, you were followed by floating televisions - or floating flatscreens if you like.  Let's say that there are 5 of them.  Now imagine that on each one of these there is something playing that is *very* interesting and at a volume that varies between unignorable and a phone held away from the ear.  How hard would it be to hold a job, finish or even be at all productive at your projects?  This is what my brain has been doing since I was about 10 or so.

# Enough is enough.

At the tender age of 39 I'm finally getting some help with this.  I've always secretly thought that there was something fundamentally wrong with me.  For instance, in grade school I was sent to remedial math classes.  It wasn't until high school that I figured out that if I drank enough coffee and smoked enough cigarettes, I could exert a noticeable amount of control over this.  Then in my senior year of high school, I discovered that marijuana almost completely removed them from the equation.  The problem with that, aside from the social implications, was that it slowed my head down far too much to be very productive.  In hindsight, I was probably smoking way too much.  Much later, working for an independent game company, I discovered others that had found the same solution to the problem.  One in particular could hardly get anything done, but was a Rembrandt with a text editor and by far one of the best programmers I've ever met when he was completely stoned.

This has affected every aspect of my life.  Looking back at my career, I have been astoundingly fortunate to work at some of the best tech companies in the business despite my completely shoddy track record.  In two instances in particular, I was in a position to walk away with an obscene amount of money for my work.

# Not faking it.

The problem with me isn't lack of technical ability, in fact if I can get past the phone screen and the inevitable "We were looking at your work history and had some concerns ..", and can relax and calm myself down sufficiently before the interview, I interview very well.  I've spent countless hours of my own time to make sure that I understand the fundamentals.  Since I couldn't go to college, despite trying three times, I had to make up for it in sheer desire to learn.  It doesn't hurt that I'm thoroughly addicted to the spritz of dopamine I get when I start writing original code in a new language, or learn and really get down a new technique.

# That's not enough!

Still, as much as I know, and I'll be the first to admit that the more I learn, the more I learn that I only know a fraction of what's there, that's not enough!  It's not enough to be fortunate enough to have a job doing what you do when you have spare time.  The practice of taking an idea and creating something useful from it is, aside from hanging out with my family, what I truly love to do.  The degree of drive I feel to do it isn't even remotely approached by anything else that I do.  Still, it's not enough.

Looking back, it's easy to see what happened.  At least, I think I understand what happened.  Distilled, what I end up doing is having complete conversations, either individually or in a meeting, with people wherein I might make a commitment to do something, and ten minutes later not even remember that I had the conversation.  Sounds crazy, doesn't it?  I don't know how many times I've been told `Clint, I thought you said you were going to ...`, or `Clint, I thought we talked about ...`, or `Who was supposed to handle that?  Clint?  Oh, ok, So, Clint, where are we at on that?`.  This is all one thing if you are a teenager, but I'm a grown man, damned near 40, with kids, a wife, and a mortgage.

# Determination

Well, I can either give up or I can do something about it.  I'm choosing to do something about it.  I had a formal diagnosis of adult ADHD [1] and am trying a low dose of a medication.  The last thing I want to do is rely on a pill to take my problem away.  I'm taking it to level the playing field and help me help myself more effectively.  This combined with the admission to myself that I'm just, by god, going to have to start writing stuff down and the time is now to start making myself do it.

# The first day.

Discoveries

+ I read part of a book!  No, I mean I *read* it!  I didn't just skip around looking for the good stuff, I actually read it slowly and methodically and thought about what I was reading.  This was the first 'holy shit' moment.

+ I was much calmer, and actually a little sleepy.  Speed has the opposite effect on people like me.  A vente americano from Starbucks can put me to sleep. I'm not kidding about this.  I had to stop drinking them because I was nodding off at work.

+ I listened to my wife and had a conversation with her that didn't consist of me waiting for her to stop talking so I could say the much more important thing that was on my mind at that very second.
