  I have pretty severe (apparently) adult ADHD.  I hesitate to quantify it as 'adult' since I've never known life without it, but it has been severely limiting.  I've tried taking medication for it, but due to another... 'thing' I have, I don't handle stimulants well.  So, I've been searching for ways to combat my lack of focus and attention.

  Search for 'Einstein on the Beach' on your music teat of choice.  I hadn't heard it before and it's, so far, the perfect blend of repetition to keep that part of my brain active while I do other stuff.

  It's really interesting that I have to keep half of my brain active while I use the other half to write code and words, or generally do anything non-trivial.  Actually, it kinda pisses me off when I think about it, but that passes quickly.
