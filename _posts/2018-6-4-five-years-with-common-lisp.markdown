It's been five years since I resolved to do all of my development in Common Lisp and looking back, my only regret is that I hadn't made the decision earlier.  Here's a quick list of the benefits I've found so far.

- Programming a live system
- Images (or if you're a lisp machine dreamer, worlds)
- Code transformation and to a lesser extent, generation.
 - I'm now convinced that code generation should be kept to a minimum.
- CLOS/MOP
- Freedom
- System Malleability
- I genuinely feel like I can do anything I can think up... for better or worse.

I'll add to or modify this in the next few days as I think of good ways to expand on these points.
