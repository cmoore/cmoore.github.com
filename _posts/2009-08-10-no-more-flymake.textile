p(meta). Flymake made me lazy

I'm trying to switch from Emacs and flymake to TextMate for a while.  Thinking back, it took what seemed forever to get flymake to work correctly with Emacs but the fact that it doesn't seem to be able to handle multiple source files.

Plus, I think flymake made me complacent with haskell.  Yes, it's convenient to have immediate feedback on the source you are typing, but it also becomes a crutch.

Time will tell.
