p(meta). Mongrel2

The only thing I really don't like about Mongrel2 is that there's no official release.  I really really want to replace the HappStack handlers that I'm using for IPT.  Not that there is anything wrong with Happstack, mind you.  It's just that it's a huge-ass dependency to require for just happstack.server.

Mongrel2 is quite fast though, if somewhat unstable.
