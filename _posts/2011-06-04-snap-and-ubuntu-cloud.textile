title: Ubuntu Server and Snap

h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). It's like the future.

This is a trip report about scaling a Snap application with the Ubuntu Server Cloud Thingy.

h3. Honk


I'm downloading the images now.  I'll be installing Natty on my main development box (i7/12g/120g ssd), one 2x xeon file server with about 1.2tb of storage, and one 4x xeon with 8 gig of ram for the first node.


I have 20 of the 4x xeon machines that I can use if I really, really have to.  I'd love to get them all running, but there's no way my power meter would be able to handle the RPM.


What I want to do is come up with a nice way to add and remove application servers as well as have a centralized storage that can also scale.  I'll be using MongoDB for all of the backend storage so I don't think this will be a problem.  My initial plan is to configure the application servers to also act as storage nodes and use MongoDBs auto-balancing cluster feature thing.  I can't remember offhand what it's called, but I remember setting it up at one point.

h3. Much much much later

I'm glad no one reads this but me.  This whole endevour ended up being a huge yak-shaving expedition to which I ended up saying "fuckit, why don't I just finish the original project?"

Not to figure out how to skip step 1 of that process.
