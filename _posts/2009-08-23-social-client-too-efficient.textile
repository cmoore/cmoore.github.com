p(meta). The dangers of code that's -too- good.

Since progress on <a href="http://github.com/cmoore/rwc">RWC</a> has gone so well, the volume at which I can process social networking messages has gone to hither-to unimagined proportions.  Because of this, I started following everyone and everything I was familiar with without regard for whether I had any actual useful interaction with them at all or not.  Well, it has now become a problem and the only real solution is to start unfollowing/unfriending people.  Let me take a better crack at explaining:

I use Twitter.  A lot.  In a lot of ways, it has replaced email for me, and I am to the point where I check it far more than I do my email.  It wasn't always this way though.  I used to be one of those people who "didn't 'get' twitter."  I understand those who say that it is hard to grasp what's so useful about the service until you find out that someone or something that you care about is posting updates to Twitter.  Now, I'm not talking about the "I just made a tunafish sandwich and took a dump." messages, but rather links, or information pertinent to work that you are doing, or topics that you care about.  Follow enough of these people posting actual useful information, and it becomes almost indispensable.
