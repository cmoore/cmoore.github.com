h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). Can't we do better than this?

It happened again.  I was catching up on twitter, and I read about a project called 'Vagrant'.  The idea seems great!  You install a gem, run a few commands and magically (well, for a given value of magic) a vm appears running under virtualbox with a dev environment.  I was immediately excited.

Then I tried to use it.

At least I didn't spend too much time trying to get it to run correctly this time.  I've been known to waste entire days chasing dreams like this.  The simplified version is:

# Follow the directions / install and configure.
# Try to run.
# Get an obscure error. Search google.
# Find a fix which was added relatively recently to the source.  Repo is on github, even nicer.
# Purge it from my machine with extreme prejudice and then clone the latest source and install that way using what ever branch is the latest.
# SAME FUCKING ERROR MESSAGE.

It's not supposed to be this hard, but I'll try again in a few days.
