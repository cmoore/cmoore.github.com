h1. What is Ivy?

I wanted a simple but reasonably secure web framework-a-like.  Simple and secure should not be opposing qualities.

h1. Give me an example

Assuming you've decided to use HStringTemplate

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  tg <- tgroup "templates"
  start
    "tcp://127.0.0.1:9997"
    "tcp://127.0.0.1:9996"
    "hreddit"
    (app tg)
```

This is a test of static pages.

h4. Honk honk

That was a title.
