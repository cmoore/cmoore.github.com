      <p>
      "Taught that programming - or worse 'developing software' - is like a routine engineering activity, many find difficulty seeing writing as a model or even a metaphor for programming.  Writing is creative, it is self-expression, it is art, which is to say it isn't a science and unlike science and engineering, it isn't a serious activity.  Judgements like this, though, are easiest made by people who don't seriously engage in making both science and art.  Art, engineering, and science are - in that order - part of a continuum of finding truth in the world and about ourselves."</p>
